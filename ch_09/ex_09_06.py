# Exercise 09_05 from Deitel: Intro to Python and CS

"""
Reimplement Exercise 9.3 using the json module to write the student information to the file in JSON format.
For this exercise, create a dictionary of student data in the following format:
gradebook_dict = {"students": [student1dictionary, student2dictionary, ...]}
Each dictionary in the list represents one student and contains the keys:
"first_name", "last_name", "exam1", "exam2" and "exam3",
which map to the values representing studentâ€™s first name (string), last name (string) and three exam scores (integers).
Output the gradebook_dict in JSON format to the file grades.json.
