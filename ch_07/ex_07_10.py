# Exercise 07_10 from Deitel: Intro to Python for CS

"""
Write a script to play 2D Tic-Tac-Toe between two human players who alternate entering their moves.
Use a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array.
Each player indicates their moves by:
entering a pair of numbers representing the row and column indices of the square in which they want to place their mark,
either an 'X' or an 'O'.
When the first player moves, place an 'X' in the specified square.
When the second player moves, place an 'O' in the specified square.
ach move must be to an empty square.
After each move, determine whether the game has been won and whether itâ€™s a draw.
