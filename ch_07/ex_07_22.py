# Exercise 07_22 from Deitel: Intro to Python for CS

"""
Perform the following tasks with pandas Series:

a) Create a Series from the list [7, 11, 13, 17].
b) Create a Series with five elements that are all 100.0.
c) Create a Series with 20 elements that are all random numbers in the range 0 to 100.

Use method describe to produce the Seriesâ€™ basic descriptive statistics.

d) Create a Series called temperatures of the floating-point values 98.6, 98.9, 100.2 and 97.9.
Using the index keyword argument, specify the custom indices 'Julie', 'Charlie', 'Sam' and 'Andrea'.

e) Form a dictionary from the names and values in Part (d), then use it to initialize a Series.
