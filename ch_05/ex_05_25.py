"""
Modify Exercise 5.24 to deal a five-card poker hand as a list of five card tuples.
Then create functions (i.e., is_pair, is_two_pair, is_three_of_a_kind, â€¦)
that determine whether the hand they receive as an argument contains groups of cards, such as one pair etc.
Assign numerical value to hand based on cards they receive
